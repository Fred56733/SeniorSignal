## Overview

### Description

SeniorSignal is an app designed to provide peace of mind to family and caregivers of elderly individuals. The app prompts the elderly user to verify their well-being at intervals chosen by their designated contacts. If there's no response within a certain timeframe, an alert is sent to the contact, ensuring timely checks and assistance if needed.
